## Introduction
### What is Digital Electronics?


Digital electronics is a field of electronics involving the study of digital signals. These circuits usually  made from large assemblies of logic gates, often packaged in integrated circuits. Digital systems constructed by using logic gates. These gates are the AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, EXOR and EXNOR gates.The OR gate is an electronic circuit that gives a high output if one or more of its inputs are high.
In digital circuits, an adderâ€“subtractor is a circuit that is capable of adding or subtracting numbers. Similarly to the half adder, a half subtractor subtracts two 1 bit binary numbers to give two outputs, difference and borrow.

### Basic Logic & Universal Gates in Digital Electronics 


All digital systems constructed by only three basic logic gates. These basic gates are called the AND gate, the OR gate, and the NOT gate. The Universal gates are NAND gate and NOR gate.


## Advantages Of Digital Electronics

1. Digital Electronic circuits are relatively easy to design.

2. It has higher precision rate in terms of accuracy.

3. Transmitted signals are not lost over long distance.

4. Digital Signals can be stored easily.

5. Digital Circuits have the flexibility that can change the functionality of digital circuits by making changes in software instead of changing actual circuit.
