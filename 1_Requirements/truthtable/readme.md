# Basic Gates

**AND GATE**                   

And gate is the one which gives an high output if all the inputs are high

# UNIVERSAL GATES

**NAND GATE**

The NAND gate is a NOT-AND circuit which is equivalent to an AND circuit followed by a NOT circuit. The output of the NAND gate is high if any of its inputs is low.

**NOR GATE**

The NOR gate is a NOT-OR circuit which is equivalent to an OR circuit followed by a NOT circuit. The output of the NOR gate is low if any of its inputs is high.
